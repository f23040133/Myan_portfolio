# Cybersecurity Engineer — Portfolio

This is a professional portfolio built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It follows a dark cybersecurity aesthetic and includes sections for projects, certifications, skills, achievements, and contact.

Quick start (Windows `cmd.exe`):

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

Notes:
- Replace `public/resume.pdf` with your real resume PDF.
- The contact form is a frontend stub; wire to your email/API for production.
- All icons come from `lucide-react`.

Customization tips:
- Edit content in `src/data/projects.js` and component text in `src/components/`.
- Tailwind settings are in `tailwind.config.cjs`.
